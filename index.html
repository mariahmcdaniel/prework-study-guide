      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information (metadata) about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
        <li>With semantic HTML elements, the name is a desciption of its content and the role it plays on a webpage.

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>declaration : contains two important components- the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the
          property </li>
        <li>selector : defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
        <li>margin : property that indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>padding : property that adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are
          actually making the entire element bigger</li>
        <li>* selector : used to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. With this special wild card
          symbol, we declare that ALL of the elements on the page will have the specified style properties </li>
        <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together using a comma to combine two
          or more selectors into a single CSS rule. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code</li>
        <li>Link CSS style sheet to html with :<br>
          link rel="stylesheet" href="file-name.css" <br> enclosed in angle brackets, in the head section of html doc
          after the final
          meta element and before the title element

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>Markdown (.md) is the way content files are formatted in GitHub. It is a way to write for the web using
          plain text that easily converts to HTML</li>
        <li>git add -A : stage your changes; commit all files in the working branch </li>
        <li>git commit -m "short description" : commit staged changes to our repository (-m flag is used to associate a
          message with our commit)</li>
        <li>git pull origin main : command used to pull in the base branch in order to make sure that our current branch
          is up to date before opening a PR; it is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch
          before pushing up any code</li>
        <li>If branches are in sync when we run the previous command, we get the "already up to date" message.</li>
        <li>git push origin *desired branch* such as, feature/add-html : push up all of our changes</li>
