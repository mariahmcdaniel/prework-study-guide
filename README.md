# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this study guide in order to keep my class notes in one useful place so that I can refer back to them as I progress through the web developer bootcamp. Through the process of creating this application, I learned many useful tools such as how to combine HTML CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive website

Each section contains notes about a certain topic. The topics at hand are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If you open the dev tools, you can see the JavaScript running which will list the topics covered in the course pre-work and give a suggestion on which topic to study first
